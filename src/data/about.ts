  journey: {
    story: "My path into tech wasn't exactly planned. I studied Electrical Engineering at Finolex Academy of Management and Technology in Ratnagiri. Somewhere along the way, someone suggested I try software development. Out of curiosity, I gave it a shot — and quickly realized how much I enjoyed it. One thing led to another, and what started as an experiment turned into a genuine passion and, eventually, a career I truly love.",
    passion: "These days, my weekday evenings often involve exploring new tools, tech trends, or open-source projects — nothing beats the excitement of learning and trying out something new."
